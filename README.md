# exam_maker

A project written in Python 3 designed to help teachers and professors with their exam/test making! 

This project currently contains two file: exam_maker.py is the main body of the program, it contains a class named Exam which stores info on an exam, as well as methods that modify and output the exam; exam_maker_i.py is the interface of the program, it contains user interactions as well as file I/O functions. 

Would love to add a graphical component to it but sadly I don't yet know how, so all the input is done through the Python interface.
